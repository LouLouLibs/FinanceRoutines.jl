# FinanceRoutines.jl

*Some useful tools to work with academic financial data in Julia*

## Introduction

This package provides a collection of routines for academic finance work. 
This is useful to get started with a clean copy of asset prices from CRSP and a ad-hoc merge with the accounting data from the Compustat Funda file. 

I have also added utilities to download treasury yield curves (GSW) and Fama-French research factors.

This is still very much work in progress: file [issues](https://github.com/louloulibs/FinanceRoutines.jl/issues) for comments.


## Installation

`FinanceRoutines.jl` is a not yet a registered package.
You can install it from github  via

```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add("https://github.com/louloulibs/FinanceRoutines.jl")
```

## Usage

  - Using WRDS (CRSP, Compustat, etc)
    + See the [WRDS User Guide](@ref) for an introduction to using the package to download data from WRDS

  - Demos to how this integrates into standard estimations
    + See how to estimate asset pricing betas in the [Estimating Stock Betas](@ref) demo.
    + Build general queries for the WRDS postgres in [Advanced WRDS](@ref)
